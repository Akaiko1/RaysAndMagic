# SPELL ADDING INSTRUCTIONS
# =============================================================================
# To add a new spell:
# 1. Add a new entry under 'spells:' with a unique key (spell ID)
# 2. Fill in all the basic spell properties
# 3. For projectile spells (is_projectile: true):
#    - Add 'physics:' section with speed, lifetime, hit_radius, collision_size
#    - Add 'graphics:' section with max_size, min_size, base_size, color
# 4. For utility spells (is_utility: true):
#    - Add effect properties like heal_amount, vision_bonus, stat_bonus, etc.
#    - Add custom message
#    - No physics or graphics sections needed
# 5. Build and test: go run .
